								<p>Art is a diverse range of human activity, and resulting product, that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power, or conceptual ideas</p>
								<p>The three classical branches of visual art are painting, sculpture, and architecture. <br>Until the 17th century, art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences. In modern usage after the 17th century, where aesthetic considerations are paramount, the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general, such as the decorative or applied arts.</p>

								<p>Every artist plays a different and necessary part in contributing to the overall health, development, and well-being of our society.</p>
								<p>An artist has the ability to ‘feel strongly’ to be ‘sensitive’ to things and express this in the paint, gesture, or color. The artist ‘absorbs’ the atmosphere of a place or the memory of a feeling. Sometimes, it’s a burden for the artist to carry all this emotion – to be so sensitive.</p>

								<p>Art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium. Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language" target="_blank">language</a> to convey meaning with immediacy or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations
									<br>
									There is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes. A common view is that the epithet "art", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt" target="_blank">Rembrandt's work</a>, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity.At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso" target="_blank"> Pablo Picasso</a>, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled
